#### Source
Launched 2013.  Various non-profits have funded it, included SPARC, JISC, Open Society Foundations, the Center for Open Science, and currently Arcadia[link].

#### What is it?

The service, much like Unpaywall, leverages existing indices of open content and if there is an open version will provide you a link to it. In fact, it actually uses Unpaywall and others to find those open resources.

<a id="value"></a>

#### Why would you use it?

Again, approximately 25-30% of the academic literature is open access \([Piwowar, 2018](https://peerj.com/articles/4375/)\)  This means that at least of quarter of all scholarship shouldn’t require a subscription.  However, the publishers of the canonical version of the article do not always link to legally available open versions, or the information about those versions do not travel through the various indices, catalogs, and so on.  In those cases, the OA Button extension will tell you whether or not there is an alternate copy available.

#### How does it work?

Installation:
Install the extension.

Use:
When you are on a webpage with an article you need access to, or if you have a URL, DOI, PMID or PMCID and just want to find out if there is an open copy, you click on the button, and/or paste in the DOI.  You can also paste in a citation, but they correctly describe that as tricky; there’s a chance it won’t work.

#### How Do You Use it?

*Installation:*<br>
First, install the extension.  Once there, it lives in your browser and works behind the scenes.

*Use:*<br>
You click on the icon when you see it indicating that there is an available copy.  Otherwise, you don’t.  Easy!

*Settings:*<br>
Change things.  Maybe provide list of acceptable domains?

#### Privacy Concerns

View their privacy policy [here](https://openaccessbutton.org/privacy).

<a id="limitations"></a>

#### Limitations

The extension only works for open access content.  If there is no open version, it doesn’t work.  It is also limited by what the OA Button and its sources have indexed.  There may be open content that they have yet to discover and index, or that they missed.  At over 25 million items, that’s probably not a frequent problem, but it is possible.
