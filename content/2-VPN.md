# UI Virtual Private Network

In this section, we'll describe the UI Virtual Private Network resource.  Note - this is not the same as commercial VPNs, such as ExpressVPN or NordVPN - those are used for individual private web connectivity.  The UI VPN is meant for university activities, including teaching, research, and administrative work.

#### What is it?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) provides a secure (encrypted) connection to the University of Idaho's network from off campus. You must have VPN access approved before you can connect to University of Idaho's network from home or while traveling.

#### Why would you use it?

Most journals authenticate using the University’s IP address range, meaning, they will recognize you as affiliated with the UI regardless which device you use on the campus – they will recognize your phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, etc.  When you connect using the VPN Tool, you establish a private network relationship with the UI campus network.  Then, journals treat you the same as if you are connecting at the UI campus.

#### How Do You Use it?

[Access](https://support.uidaho.edu/TDClient/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=599)
You first need to go to the VPN Access page for ITS.  You must request access and be approved.  When that occurs, you’ll need to download the VPN client from ITS according to your operating system.

[Use](https://support.uidaho.edu/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=40)
Once installed, you click on ‘Connect’ and log in.  Then you’re done!

<a id="privacy"></a>

#### Privacy Concerns

The primary concern with the VPN is that you are connected to the UI while the VPN is active.  This means that everything – *everything* – you do online while connected is routed through and visible on the UI servers to ITS personnel.  If using a personal device, keep this in mind.  If you use a VPN to connect for research purposes, disconnect before moving on to personal uses.  Your private business is not for the University to see and hear and/or record – it is a public institution.

#### Limitations

The primary limitation is the need to connect and disconnect as you need to.
