## ***Tools for Accessing Literature on the Web!***
### A workshop at the University of Idaho Library  

<br>
Here, we will explore a number of tools that can make it easier to access academic literature while working in your browser.  Our focus is on tools that allow you to be "away" from the UI Library website, so that you can gain access the fastest and simplest way possible!

There is more than we can cover in an hour, but here are links to <a href="{{ '/content/4-resources.html' | relative_url }}">additional resources</a> that you might find useful, or are curious for a deeper dive into the mechanics or organizations behind these tools.
